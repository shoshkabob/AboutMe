<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3><a href="http://speaksruly.herokuapp.com/">SpeakSruly</a></h3>
<p>SpeakSruly is a fun little project that my good friend and UX designer Chava Weisberg came up with and designed. We have a friend named Sruly who often posts enigmatic, eloquent Facebook statuses that not many can understand; so she thought, what if we could translate them for everyone? I built a Sinatra server that skips over designated basic English words to translate any more complicated English sentences. Since machine translation is a complicated science that involves many expensive APIs that I did not feel were a necessary investment for a fun little side project, the translation is rudimentary and often hilarious.

<h3><a href="http://harmonyti.me">HarmonyTime</a></h3>
<p>HarmonyTime utilizes the Web Audio API to play notes and recognize pitch, and a notation language called VexFlow to draw music notes right onto the webpage using HTML Canvas. I used a Ruby Sinatra server and SQLite3 database on the back-end, and JQuery and Javascript for client-side scripting.

<br><i>Note: This project is currently under construction. Better servers and more features to come!</i></p>
<h3>SocketChat</h3>
<p>SocketChat is a basic chatroom interface for the browser. It allows multiple clients to connect through a server and chat with one another. I built this using both server and client side Javascript.

<h3><a href="http://shoshkabob.github.io/">Chat App Tutorial</a></h3>
<p>This tutorial was a collaborative effort between myself and two of my classmates at General Assembly, Alexander Deschamps and Noel Sagaille. In it, we provide instruction on how to make an application like SocketChat.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/PeachSWIFT/SWIFT_Tutorial">Swift Tutorial</a></h3>
<p>This tutorial on the basics of the Apple programming language Swift was another collaborative effort between myself and two of my classmates at General Assembly, Alvin Liang and Joel Konijn. It is written using Markdown on Github and includes a sample chat application in Swift.</p>
<h3>Animali: The T-Shirt Shop</h3>
<p>Another collaborative project from General Assembly, this site is a basic web store for t-shirts. Myself, Rachel Hazes, Genevieve Gorta, and Tiffany Poss used a Sinatra server, SQLite3 database with ActiveRecord, Bootstrap CSS, and BCrypt for administrative use.
