<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I am married to a wonderful man named Akiva, and have been living in New York City on and off for about 4 years. During my first 3 years in New York, I attended Stern College for Women at Yeshiva University, from whence graduated in 2013 with a B.A. in Music. After marrying Akiva and moving here for good, I attended the City College of New York for 2 semesters, where I took Calculus II and III (and Italian! for funsies) before I discovered General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, which I completed in February 2015.

<h2>How I became a programmer</h2>
	<p>One evening in high school, I was surfing the internet and came across a website for AOL Instant Messenger icons. I noticed that these 50x50 pixel squares were all so intricately animated, and wondered who had created them. When I clicked on the profiles of many of the uploaders, I discovered that they were all around my age! I figured that this meant that I could learn how to make these graphics, too. I then purchased the favorite application of the users of this site, Jasc Animation Shop Pro 8, and went to work. But what also piqued my interest was that many of these users had their own portfolio websites that they had designed themselves. Following the previous pattern of logic, I then began to learn for myself. And how much fun I had! I then spent hours every evening honing my HTML and CSS skills. It was then that I knew I wanted to code for the rest of my life.<br>
	Unfortunately, Stern College for Women cancelled the Computer Science major before I could declare my intentions to study Computer Science. However, I still took Intro to Comp Sci and Data Structures, which gave me a great foundation in programming logic, and a Web Programming and Development course, which introduced me to JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Since I could not study Computer Science full time, my skills fell by the wayside, but I never gave up. I was lucky to have the opportunity to attend GA, and now I have all the skills I need. I continue to learn more technologies and make more projects everyday, so keep coming back to the programming page for more!
