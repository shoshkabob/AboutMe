<h2>My musical background</h2>
<p>In early 2005, I began playing guitar, and from there, a lifelong passion for music was kickstarted. 2 years later, I began to teach myself piano, and I also took voice lessons in 2008.<br>
	From September 2009 to June 2010, I participated in a gap year program in Jerusalem, Israel at which I studied music more extensively. I took guitar, voice, and drum lessons, as well as some intermediate music theory.<br>
	In college, after my attempts to study Computer Science were thwarted, I decided instead to study music as I had originally intended. While there, I studied harmony, music history, participated in chamber and choral ensembles, and composed pieces of art music. I now hold a B.A. degree in Music.</p>
<h2>What does this have to do with my career?</h2>
<p>As a developer, I would love to continue working with music. I feel that my background in music can aid in the development of websites, platforms, and applications that deliver all aspects of music and music information to users.</p>
